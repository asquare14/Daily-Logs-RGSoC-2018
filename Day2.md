#### **Tasks completed today**
   - Sent our first [Pull Request](https://github.com/ifmeorg/ifme/pull/910).

#### **Things we learnt**
  - While setting up our UI development environment *storybook*, we faced incompatibility issues. Our node version did not match that of if-me. So, we installed [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  which is a node version manager and learnt how to use and manage multiple versions of node.
  - We learnt about [web-accessibility](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html).When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. Our focus was on making our component keyboard accessible.
  - We learnt about the [bind()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) method in javascript. We understood how they can be problematic, how they affect performance and why we need to bind a function in the constructor.
  - We also learnt about arrow functions and how they act as a workaround for `bind()`.The arrow function introduced in ES6 is a function with the current ‘this’ context already bound to the function. It is a cleaner,declarative to declare React components.
  - We learnt about styling checkbox and radio button
